## Overview

This was my A-Level Project submitted in 2019. It is written in C# using the XNA game library. It was inspired by the 
game Jetpack Joyride with the added element of maths questions increasing in difficulty. A database stores statistics 
and top scores of players. A writeup is also in this repository containing details about all of the project.
